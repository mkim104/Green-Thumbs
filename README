Readme:

I would HIGHLY suggest you also look into a powerpoint that we also put in to see how the code works if you are confused.

***IMPORTANT***
Please also email me (moon_hwan_kim@brown.edu) if you want to test the application. I need to put you as a test user in order to give you login functionality. You also need a facebook account for this.


Please make sure you have the following libraries installed. Please also make sure to keep the versions the same. 
	"async": "^3.2.0",
    "bcrypt-nodejs": "0.0.3",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "connect-flash": "^0.1.1",
    "connect-mongo": "^3.2.0",
    "connect-mongodb-session": "^2.4.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.5",
    "ejs": "^3.1.6",
    "ejs-mate": "^3.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    "formidable": "^1.2.2",
    "moment": "^2.29.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.12.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7",
    "passport": "^0.4.1",

    "passport-google": "^0.3.0",
    "passport-local": "^1.0.0",
    "underscore": "^1.12.1"

Please make sure you have the MongoDB database running on your local device. Or else the information will not save to your database. I suggest install robomongo and setting up a server. 


Then type npm start into terminal and go to localhost at port 8000
